# 🕳️ Dungeon Horror Map – Prototype Level for Co-Op Horror Game

This project is an early **prototype map** for a co-op first-person horror experience built in **Unreal Engine 5**. Set in a medieval-style **sewer dungeon**, this level is designed to test lighting setups, atmospheric audio, AI behavior, and player interaction in tight, claustrophobic spaces.

## 💡 Concept

The goal is to immerse players in a light-starved dungeon environment where torches and flashlights are their only sources of visibility. The map supports horror-themed AI creatures and dynamic sound triggers to heighten tension.

## 🧱 Current Features

- 🔦 Flashlight system for exploring dark corridors  
- 🪔 Torch lighting for ambient world-building  
- 🧠 AI Enemy patrolling system (with attack logic in development)  
- 🎧 Ambient and footstep audio (including water/puddle sounds)  
- 🎮 First-person movement & map navigation  
- 🗝️ Basic level design using modular dungeon pieces

## 🔨 Tools & Tech

- **Unreal Engine 5**
- **Blueprints + C++ hybrid**
- **Free assets from Fab (e.g., Dark Ruins Sewer Dungeon)**
- **Custom lighting & sound work**
- **Git version control**

## 🧪 In Progress

- Creature attack logic refinement  
- Optimizing lighting and shadows for horror pacing  
- Adding jump scares, sound triggers, and cinematic intro  
- Playtesting multiplayer flow

## 🚧 Notes

This is a work-in-progress prototype map and may be merged into the full game project once mechanics are finalized. Any feedback or contributions are welcome!
